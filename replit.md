# Sea Level Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive sea level prediction analysis application built with Streamlit. It analyzes EPA sea level data to create visualizations and machine learning models that predict future sea level changes. The application provides an interactive dashboard for exploring historical sea level trends, training multiple ML models (linear regression, polynomial regression, random forest, XGBoost, and LSTM), and generating future predictions with confidence intervals.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
